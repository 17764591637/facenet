# Facenet
- Pytorch implementation of the paper: "FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering".
- Training of network is done using triplet loss.
- I will update codes and git repository after my doctoral defence on Nov. 20th 2018. 

# How to train model
- Download vggface2 (for training) and lfw (for validation) datasets.
  - https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Evgg/data/vgg_face2/
  - http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz

- Align face image files by following David Sandberg's instruction (part of "Face alignment").
